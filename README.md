Welcome to Chamber! This guide will help you understand how to use Chamber's voice channel features in your Discord server.

## What is Chamber?

Chamber is a powerful Discord bot that creates a dynamic voice channel experience. When you join a special "Join to Create" channel, Chamber automatically creates a temporary voice channel just for you and your friends. You have full control over this channel - you can rename it, lock it, invite people, and much more!

## Getting Started

### How to Create Your Own Voice Channel

1. **Find the Join to Create Channel**: Look for a voice channel in your server that says something like "âž• Join to Create" or "ðŸŽ¤ Create Channel"
2. **Join the Channel**: Simply click on it to join
3. **Your Channel is Created**: Chamber will automatically create a new voice channel with your name
4. **Start Talking**: You're now the owner of your own voice channel!

## Voice Channel Commands

Once you're in your voice channel, you can use these commands to manage it:

### Basic Commands (Available to Everyone)

**`/voice name <name>`**
- Rename your voice channel to any name you want
- Example: `/voice name Gaming Room`

**`/voice limit <number>`**
- Set how many people can join your channel (0-99)
- Example: `/voice limit 5` (only 5 people can join)

**`/voice lock`**
- Lock your channel so no one else can join
- Only you can unlock it later

**`/voice unlock`**
- Unlock your channel so others can join again

**`/voice permit @user`**

- Example: `/voice permit @friend`

**`/voice reject @user`**
- Kick someone out of your channel and prevent them from rejoining
- Example: `/voice reject @troublemaker`

**`/voice claim`**
- If you're in a channel where the owner left, you can claim ownership
- This gives you control of the channel

### Premium Commands (Require Premium Subscription)

## Tips and Best Practices

### Channel Management
- **Be Respectful**: Don't abuse the lock/unlock feature to exclude people unfairly
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name your channels clearly so people know what's happening

- **Check Permissions**: Make sure you have the right permissions to use commands

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"I can't use voice commands!"**
- Make sure you're in a voice channel that you own
- Check if you have the right permissions
- Try leaving and rejoining the channel

**"My channel disappeared!"**
- Channels automatically delete when everyone leaves
- If you want to keep it, make sure someone stays in it

**"I can't rename my channel!"**
- Make sure you're the owner of the channel
- Check if the server has premium features enabled
- Try the command again

**"The bot isn't responding!"**
- Use `/ping` to check if the bot is online
- Ask a moderator to check the bot status
