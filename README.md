Welcome to Chamber! This guide will help you understand how to use Chamber's voice channel features in your Discord server.

## What is Chamber?

Chamber is a powerful Discord bot that creates a dynamic voice channel experience. When you join a special "Join to Create" channel, Chamber automatically creates a temporary voice channel just for you and your friends. You have full control over this channel - you can rename it, lock it, invite people, and much more!

## Getting Started

### How to Create Your Own Voice Channel

1. **Find the Join to Create Channel**: Look for a voice channel in your server that says something like "‚ûï Join to Create" or "üé§ Create Channel"
2. **Join the Channel**: Simply click on it to join
3. **Your Channel is Created**: Chamber will automatically create a new voice channel with your name
4. **Start Talking**: You're now the owner of your own voice channel!

- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name your channels clearly so people know what's happening
- **Save Profiles**: Create presets for quick setup

### Getting Help

- **Ask Moderators**: Server moderators can help with bot issues
- **Check Permissions**: Make sure you have the right permissions to use commands

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"I can't use voice commands!"**
- Make sure you're in a voice channel that you own
- Check if you have the right permissions
- Try leaving and rejoining the channel

**"My channel disappeared!"**
- Channels automatically delete when everyone leaves
- If you want to keep it, make sure someone stays in it

**"I can't rename my channel!"**
- Make sure you're the owner of the channel
- Wait 6 minutes between renames (cooldown to prevent spam)
- Try the command again

**"I can't save more profiles!"**
- Free users get 1 profile - upgrade to premium for 20 profiles
- Premium users have a 20 profile limit

**"The bot isn't responding!"**
- Use `/ping` to check if the bot is online
- Ask a moderator to check the bot status
